    Problem Statement:
    Gushing through the crowd, pushing your way through , only to find out that your room number isn’t on that notice board , during the exams. What do you do then ? Rush towards another board and repeat the same thing all over again ? Clock’s ticking! Question papers have been distributed. The struggle’s real.
This is what we are aiming at. To create a seating arrangement based program for student’s benefit, while searching his seat for his written examination. The main motive of this technology would be printing the exact location of the student's exam bench only by giving his roll number. The program can be used outside exam centre as well, where a particular student entering, will just enter his roll number and would get his exact location, thus saving time and peace of mind!

Guidelines:
    1. Only Authority providing password can access Authority button and Refresh button.
    2. Students can only access the student button to get their seating status.
Password for Authority: KIIT239

We have even provided a Power point presentation that describes properly tthe functioning of our website.
